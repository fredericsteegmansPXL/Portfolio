        <p>Hi and welcome to my Bio page.<br><br>
          My name is Frederic Miguel Fransisco Léon Steegmans Guerrero. Most people just call me Fré.<br>
          I was born on the 18th of August in the year 2000 somewhere in Belgium.<br>
          Throughout my life I pursue to fulfill my dreams and aspirations.<br><br>
          Currently i study 'Digitaal Vormgeving' at PXL in my hometown, Hasselt. In my free time I try to stay healthy by going to the gym, playing football with my club Herk Sport and try to have a balanced diet.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I'm also a leader at the scouts called Sint Michiel Anne Frank.<br>
          From time to time I am part of a Dj duo consisting of Rikkie FF and myself a.k.a. dr. FRE.<br><br>
          Next to love, the most important thing in life is entertainement. I like to entertaine people
          in every way.

         My moto is: be uncommon amongst uncommon people. This is the only way to great succes. I love uncommon people and uncommon thing. People describe me as uncommon because of my creativity and entertaining skills.<br><br>
         My goal is to help other people become more uncommon and to eventually stand out and achieve more.

          My life started when a balding Belgian IT-nerd met a beautiful Spanish embassy worker.
          These were my parents, thus making me and my two older sisters half Spanish, half Belgian.<br>
          Eventually I was born on the 18th of August in the year 2000 in an okay-sized town in
          Belgium called Hasselt.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I travelled a lot with my family and friends, but I never lived abroad. <br>
          I visited: The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, France, Poland, Italy, Croatia, Florida, California, Utah, Nevada, Mecxico and Egypt.
          I'd love to visit a lot more countries in the future.<br>
          Like I said, i never really lived somewhere else than Hasselt,
          except when I studied 2 years in Leuven where I stayed during the week.

          I love Hasselt. I'ts not to big and certainly not too small.
          Crime rate is pretty low and their are certainly no dangerous animals around.
          Hasselt is a good city to start a family and live an easy life.<br>
          I do not know if i wanna stay here or not. We'll see.

        <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated highschool in 2018. I studied 'Wiskunde Wetenschappen' which roughly translates to Maths & Sciences.<br>
          I Always knew I did not really belong in the school  that I went too.
          I had a lot of friends and had pretty good grades (because I am smart, duh), but my interests lie somewhere else.<br>
          I almost studied for fighterpilot at the Airforce but right before I could start the doctor told me my eyesight was just not good enough.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I then persued a bachelor in economics but that only lasted a semester.<br>
          After that I thought to myself I should probably study something with sciences because I was good at it and actually enjoyed doing that from time to time.
          So i did that for 3 months and then said "nope".<br> <br>
          Since I wasn't studying, I started working at different places and warehouses.<br>

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-3 p-5">
        <p>
          This is where I really understood why I had toget a good degree.
          So in september 2019 until february 2022 I studied Physiotherapy.<br> <br>
          Eventually I quit this aswel. Both Covid-19 and my lack of interest made
          do it. But the main reason was the passing of my father on 20-8-2021.
          This turned me quite depressed and let to a loss of empathy. <br>
          After losing control and suffering from panic attacks I managed to reprogrammed
          my brain through therapy and mostly mindfulness and meditation so i became a better version of myself and pursue my dreams again.

        <h2>HOBBYS</h2>
        <p>
          I think I was around the age of six when I started playing football.
          I still play as a midfielder for Herk Sport.<br>
          I always dreamt about playing for my favourite club, KRC Genk.
          I once did when I was a child, for a month and then I got kicked out because I didn't behave properly.<br>
          Oh well.<br><br>

          Around the age of seven I started going to de scouts of Sint-Michiel Anne Frank.
          I am still active as a leader. here is where i found love,
          friendship and perseverance. I learned a lot during my time at the scouts and still am.
        </p><br>

      </div>

      <div class="col-md-3 p-5">
        <p>
          I believe everyone who goes to the scouts has a certain advantage in life compared to those who never went or were associated with the scouts.
          Social, building and resbonsability skills is what I find important in life.
          I learned these skills mainly because of scouts.<br><br>

          Then we got music. Whenever I listen to music I become a different person.<br>
          I love music like I love lemons. A LOT! Music brings people together and it can change the mood and setting instantly. <br>
          I learned myself how to play the guitar and a little pit of piano. I never had time for real lessons because of my other hobbys which I find unfortunate.

          Therefore I not a professional musician.
          I do however make my own beats with my DJ-partner in my free time.
          He is called Rikkie FF. My stagename is dr.FRE. <br>
          We dj at parties from time to time.
          It really is an awesome hobby. Free entrance, free drinks, controlling the music, the attention AND getting paid!
          Truly amazing.
          <br>We like to play commercial music, RnB, HipHop (my preference), DnB, House and sometimes techno.
          It all depends on the party I guess. <br>
          Oh yeah, I used to be in the national youth choir.
          I think thats why I love to sing in the car and shower (note: not at same time).
        </p><br>

      <div class="col-md-3 p-5">
        <p>
          All these hobby's together with school, family and friends makes it difficult sometimes to keep up with my schedule.<br>
          That's why I am always planning and trying to figure out for myself what I find most important and what is less important.<br>
          I struggle to choose sometimes because my interests are all over the place.
          It's a blessing with a curse really. I seem to be easily entertained and inspired but also quickly distracted unless I've got work to do.
